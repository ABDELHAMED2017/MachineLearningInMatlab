Machine Learning Algorithms in MATLAB:

This repository represents a library of modular general-purpose machine learning algorithms
implemented in MATLAB, as well as example/test cases in the 'asmt' files showing their usage.

Algorithms covered include:

- Linear regression using gradient descent
- Least-squares linear system solver
- Logistic regression for binary classification
- Nearest-neighbour (and nearest-K neighbor) for 1D data; binary classifier variant as well
- Neural Networks trained via backpropagation:
  * early-stop variant
  * binary classification / log-likelihood maximizaton variant
  * vanilla variant
  * application note: incidence matrix set up makes architecture easy to change for user
